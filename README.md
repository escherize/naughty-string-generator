# naughty-string-generator

A Clojure library designed to help you crash your programs! (During testing.)

Based on this [big list of naughty strings][1], here's a generator for use with spec, test.check, or anywhere else you'd like to generate naughty strings.

## Usage

``` clojure

(ns my-ns
  (:require [naughty-string-generator.core :as nsg]
            [clojure.spec :as s]
            [clojure.spec.gen :as sg]))


(s/exercise (s/gen nsg/naughty-strings))
;;=>



```
